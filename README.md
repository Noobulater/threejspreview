# Three.js WebSocket and File Loader Integration Guide

This guide explains how to lift the WebSocket connection and file loading functionality (GLB/GLTF and HDR) from the provided code and integrate it into a different Three.js-based application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that your application meets the following requirements:
- Your application uses Three.js.
- You have a Three.js scene with a camera, renderer, and basic scene setup (or are ready to set this up).
- You have a working environment capable of handling JavaScript modules (ES6 imports).

## Features to Integrate

This integration focuses on the following features from the provided code:
1. **WebSocket Connection**: Enables real-time communication to receive GLB/GLTF models over WebSocket.
2. **File Loading (GLB/GLTF & HDR)**: Allows for drag-and-drop or WebSocket-based loading of GLB/GLTF files (for 3D models) and HDR files (for environment maps).

### Steps for Integration

### 1. Set Up WebSocket Connection

#### Lift the WebSocket Setup:
The provided code establishes a WebSocket connection to receive GLB files. Below is the WebSocket setup that you need to integrate into your own application.

#### How to Integrate:
- Ensure that the URL (`ws://localhost:42069`) is replaced with your actual WebSocket server's URL.
- Call the `connect()` function when your Three.js application starts, so the WebSocket connection is immediately established.

### 2. Implement File Loading

The file loading functionality allows you to load `.glb`, `.gltf`, and `.hdr` files into the scene. Here's how to implement the file loading:

#### Lift the File Loading Logic:
Add this file loading logic to handle the drag-and-drop or WebSocket-based loading of GLTF/GLB models and HDR environment maps:

<CODEBLOCK HERE>

#### Drag-and-Drop Event Setup:
Set up drag-and-drop functionality for loading files by adding event listeners:

<CODEBLOCK HERE>

#### How to Integrate:
- Ensure that `loadGLTF(gltf, anchor)` correctly integrates with your existing Three.js scene to add the loaded 3D model to the scene.
- Use the `RGBELoader` for environment maps, adding HDR files as backgrounds and environment maps.

### 3. Progress Bar (Optional)

If you want to integrate the progress bar for file loading, make sure to update the progress display within the `loadFile` function:

### 4. Resize Handling

Ensure that your application can handle window resizing by adding this code:

### Final Integration Checklist

1. **WebSocket Setup**:
   - Integrate the `connect()`, `checkConnection()`, and WebSocket handlers in your application to receive GLB/GLTF models via WebSocket.
   
2. **File Loading**:
   - Ensure that `loadFile(file)` is called when a file is dropped onto the page or received via WebSocket.
   - Handle GLTF/GLB models and HDR environment maps in your existing Three.js scene.

3. **Optional**: Add progress bar functionality by updating the DOM during file loading.

4. **Resize Handling**: Ensure that the camera and renderer respond to window resizing to maintain correct aspect ratios.

By following these steps, you can successfully lift the WebSocket and file loading features from the provided code and integrate them into your Three.js application.
